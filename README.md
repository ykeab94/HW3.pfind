1. I have used fork to create child process which is child. Also, I've used signal mechanism to receive a termination command from user as if a user press crtl+q, then the message "Do you want to quit?" appears and if 'y' is pressed then the program ends. 

2. I have implemented sender and receiver by using execl.
